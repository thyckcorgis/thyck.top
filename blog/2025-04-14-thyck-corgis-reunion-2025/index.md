Juyoung is temporarily "working remotely" so we were able to meet up last Friday
(April 11).

We ate at Kinjo and ordered lots of sushi rolls ðŸ’¸ðŸ’¸ðŸ’¸

I also got to show off my new phone's features:

After getting stuffed (ðŸ˜³), we drove to Whyte Ave and got
[DRTY ice cream](https://www.instagram.com/drtyicecream). They were kinda
questioning the name at first, but I assured them it's not actually dirty. The
[sari-sari store](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sari-sari_store) was a good
photo-op spot and I was able to convince Will and Annette to take pictures like
a proud Filipino mom.

Apparently Sunflower Crackers was Annette's childhood. She also has Filipino
spaghetti sauce at home so she's probably secretly ðŸ‡µðŸ‡­.

After getting ice cream, we walked around Whyte Ave and got the typical Whyte
Ave Friday Night Treatment (got asked for spare change/cigarettes, people
running around while giving piggyback rides, ðŸŒ¿ smell within 5m of an
establishment, etc). Truly brings us back to our undergrad days.

I will try taking more photos next time ðŸ˜­ also of myself
